# Math Formula Calulator
This is a project which I had written for my final in Intro to Java II at Mira Costa College.

# How to run

After compiling all the files, run the program via Main.java.

# What this program does

- _Simplify Radical_ - For this feature you are asked to write any number that is under a radical.

Example output:
    √27 simplified is 3√3.
    √144 simplified is 12
    √67 cannot be simplified. 
    
- **Convert Temperature** - You can select what temperature scale (fahrenheit, celsius, or kelvin) and it will convert it to the other two types. 

Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin
Converts Celsius to Fahernhiet and Kelvin
Converts Kelvin to Fahrenhiet and Celsius

- **Quadratic Solver** - This will solve a trinomial quation. If it cannot be simplified it will return the answer in quadatric form,

- Solving for the sides and/or angles of a triangle. 
The different formulas that could be used are:
- **SSS triangle**  - Enter the value of the three sides. It should return if if could be a triangle, and if so it will show the angles. 
- **AAS Tringle** - Enter two of the angles of the triangle, and one side. As with the above formula, it will return the same information.
- **SAS Triangle** - Enter two sides, and one angle. As with the above formula, it will return the same information.

- **Solve for points** - Enter the values for x1, y1, x2, y2. You can solve for distance, midpoint or slope.
